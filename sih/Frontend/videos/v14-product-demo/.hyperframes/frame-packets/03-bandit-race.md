- roles: scroll-100 = background (dim ~35%, full-bleed race stage)
- sfx: click-soft, typing

Reproduce: trigger hands to the machine, theater plays, receipt teases at the tail.
Scene 1 (0.0–4s): challenger tag "Bandit" flips in via hard-cut word-swap → discrete-text-sequence; cursor presses Run: click + ripple with button compression → cursor-click-ripple.
Scene 2 (4–10s): waterfall rows stream newest-first as the VO says "watch the waterfall" (live internals → svg-icon-enrichment on row ticks); tiles tick up.
Scene 3 (10–22s): machine theater continues — rows land, counters tick; camera holds locked, no back-half push.
Scene 4 (22–25s): stream settles; heard-tile glows via keyword glow → asr-keyword-glow on "Green is caught"; hold into the harness transition.

# agent-progress-theater — Agent Progress Theater

**intent**: Agent work performed as WORKING-STATE theater — a short trigger beat hands the frame to the machine, which then visibly _works_: loaders spin, status phrases swap, dots pulse, counters tick — before the receipt arrives as a card whose rows cascade in and CHANGE STATE (badges flip to checks, labels strike through, severity pills read out), or as a conversation thread building message-by-message onto a camera push-in payoff. The subject is the machine performing labor over time. It is NOT a typed prompt awaiting output (no prompt/input is ever typed — the trigger is a click, a menu choice, or an already-running scan); NOT `cursor-ui-demo` (at most ONE igniting click here, then the cursor exits and the UI performs itself); NOT `grid-card-assemble` (rows there assemble into a static enumeration and hold — rows here are alive: they arrive as agent output and then MUTATE, checking off one by one while the viewer watches).

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from `agent-progress-theater`): when the feature is the agent doing multi-step work (build a plan / scan a repo / fix a vulnerability / handle infra for you) and the proof is status theater — a loader lockup with a typed label, status couplets swapping under an `[accent]` spinner, then a checklist/findings card that populates and checks off in front of the viewer.
- Key_Feature (from `message-thread-payoff`): when the agent's work lives inside a conversation or automation thread — user/agent bubbles and tool-call/reply cards popping in sequence, the working state carried by pulsing loading dots or rapidly ticking diff counters, resolved by ONE camera push-in tight on the confirmation line (`[reaction pill]`, "Sent using `[@Bot]`", a thank-you bubble).

**duration**: 4.2–11.6s (short members are a single card-and-check-off or thread beat at ~4–5s; long members chain trigger → interstitial → status swaps → receipt card at ~9–12s; thread payoff spans 4.2–9.1s)

**shot structure** (a warm flat canvas — `[off-white / warm beige / near-white bg]`, optional `[faint grid / dot-grid / wavy-line]` texture; white rounded cards with soft drop shadows; ONE `[working accent]` color reserved for the machine (spinner, status words, active step) and one `[done color]` for completion (checks, "Completed"); camera static or ONE slow move — motion is overwhelmingly element-level springs, staggers, and state flips. Two folded sub-shapes — **(A) checklist/findings theater** and **(B) message-thread payoff**.)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s) — the trigger.** Something asks the machine to work, in ONE beat:
  - _Variant — option menu (A)_: a centered white pill card poses `[the question]`; it SPRINGS open downward into a rounded menu — `[3–4 option rows]` fade/slide in staggered, each with a number badge. A cursor enters, hover-dances between rows (a pale `[hover fill]` highlight follows it), and CLICKS the chosen row (~press-down spring); the whole menu scales down toward its center and fades out. This is the only cursor appearance in the shot.
  - _Variant — modal click (A)_: close-up of a white modal with `[Dismiss]` / `[action button]`; a hand cursor clicks the action (quick press-down spring); the modal fades away. Optionally followed by a serif `[interstitial line]` on the bare canvas — words land staggered, hold, fade out word-staggered as the bg swaps.
  - _Variant — already working (A)_: a `[Scan in progress]`-style state — a thin `[accent]` arc spinner rotating over a heading + body copy + a `[Starting…]` pill (cursor resting on it, motionless); only the spinner moves. The whole scene then rapidly scales up and fades — a push-through exit.
  - _Variant — workspace push-through (A)_: a rapid camera push-in THROUGH a multi-panel `[workspace: builder / editor / terminal]` — panels scale past the viewport edges and clear away to the bare canvas.
  - _Variant — thread opener (B)_: a `[user bubble]` spring-pops in ("`[the ask]`"), OR a stats card pops in whose green/red `[diff counters]` rapidly tick and settle — the automation's opening receipt.

- **Scene 2 (~1–4s) — the working state (the machine performs).** The frame belongs to the machine; nothing is clickable. Pick 1–3 working motifs and CHAIN them:
  - A loader lockup: a spinning `[accent asterisk / arc]` beside a `[working label]` typed on rapidly ("`Buildi` → `Building plan…`"), a left→right shimmer sweep passing through the letters; the spinner may momentarily morph asterisk↔dot and back.
  - Status couplets: 2–3 centered pairs — a dark `[action line]` over an `[accent status word]` ("Thinking…", "Noodling…") with its spinner — swapping via quick fades/slides at a steady cadence.
  - A `[scan/tool label]` types/expands rightward to its full string, then SHRINKS and DOCKS to the top-left as a fixed corner header (the canvas now belongs to what it produces).
  - A status heading flips tense as rows land beneath it ("Using `[Tool]`" → "Used `[Tool]`"), with a gently pulsing "Thinking" and gray meta-lines ("Exploring `[N]` files…") fading in below.
  - _Variant — thread machinery (B)_: the `[agent reply]` fades/slides up, then a monospace `[tool_call]` line appears beneath it — small icon + `[tool name]` + three pulsing loading dots; OR an instruction bubble scrolls into view (internal window scroll, frame static) followed by a `[brand logo]` pop-in beside a "Sending message…" row. **The pulse dies the instant the result lands** — dots vanish as the payload arrives.

- **Scene 3 (~2–4s) — the receipt cascades in (the payoff engine).** The work materializes as a card that BUILDS:
  - _Variant — checklist (A)_: a white `[Progress / summary]` pill or card SPRING-pops in with a bounce, then springs open downward (or the summary card glides UP as a taller `[findings]` panel expands beneath it). Rows cascade in one by one — slide-up + fade, staggered — each with `[number badge / severity pill]` + `[label]` + optional gray `[meta line]`. Then the STATE MUTATION runs: badges flip one by one from numbered outline to a solid `[done color]` circle + white checkmark (slight scale bounce), the checked label simultaneously strikes through and dims; pending items keep partially-drawn arc outlines animating. End the run mid-list — some items checked, some still numbered — the work is visibly _ongoing_.
  - _Variant — thread payload (B)_: the camera pushes in / pans down centering the `[tool_call]` line as a white payload card expands downward from it — 2–4 light monospace `[key: value]` lines fading in. Then the `[resolution message]` expands into place below (inline `[code chips]` and `[link]` coloring), OR a dark `[thread card]` scales up from a status row to DOMINATE the frame while the background darkens, its `[reply]` expanding into place under a "1 reply" divider.

- **Scene 4 (final ~1–2.5s) — resolve.** Two endings:
  - _Variant — hold / scroll (A)_: the finished (or mid-mutation) card stack holds static to the end, OR the viewport scrolls down the final card (fast in the last beat) revealing `[a second heading + numbered list]`, ending mid-list. A slow continuous zoom into the card may run underneath (the header drifts off the top of frame).
  - _Variant — payoff push-in (B)_: ONE camera push-in + pan-down lands tight on the payoff line — "`Sent using [@Bot]`" / the confirmation + `[thank-you bubble]` spring-in — then a `[reaction button]` springs into an active pill with bouncy overshoot and a count. The push eases into a gentle near-imperceptible drift and the clip ends on the close-up. No end card.

**rule mapping**

- pill springs open downward into a menu / panel expands beneath a gliding card / payload card expands downward from a tool-call line → `anchored-layout-expand` (edge-anchored container growth: height-masked wrapper + inner counter-translate, container drawn at final size); spring flavor from `spring-pop-entrance`
- option rows / findings rows / task rows stagger in (slide-up + fade) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered-group form, ≤500ms cap) or `gsap-effects` (plain fade+translate stagger) — NOT `waterfall-entry` (its binary no-fade arrival law contradicts this dialect's soft fade/slide cascade)
- cursor glides to a row and clicks; hand cursor clicks the modal button → `cursor-click-ripple` (move + press) + `press-release-spring` (the button's press-down spring)
- pale hover-highlight fill following the cursor between rows → `gsap-effects` (a background fill translated row-to-row; no dedicated rule needed)
- menu scale-down fade exit / scene scale-up push-through exit / palette-for-window swap → `scale-swap-transition`
- thin arc spinner rotation / spinning asterisk loader → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating internal SVG parts via `setAttribute('transform','rotate(deg cx cy)')`; timeline-driven, finite)
- asterisk↔dot morph and back → `scale-swap-transition` (two elements morphing at the same center)
- typed-on loader label ("Building plan…") / scan label typing to its full string → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor` for the caret)
- left→right shimmer sweep through the loader letters → `ambient-glow-bloom` (single-pass traveling sheen) or `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep) — pick sheen for light-on-text, marker for a drawn band
- serif interstitial word-staggered fade in/out; status couplets swapping on a cadence → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (phrase windows) + `discrete-text-sequence` (the whole-state swaps); per-word stagger via `gsap-effects`
- pulsing "Thinking" label / three pulsing loading dots (phase-offset) → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats; kill the tween at the resolve beat — see doctrine note)
- status heading tense flip (Using→Used) / gray meta-lines fading in / final-token snaps → `discrete-text-sequence`
- label shrinks and docks to the top-left as a fixed corner header → `gsap-effects` (plain scale + translate tween; no dedicated rule needed)
- rapid camera push-in through the multi-panel workspace → `viewport-change` (the push) + `multi-phase-camera` (phasing) + optional `motion-blur-streak` (velocity blur as panels clear the frame)
- slow continuous zoom into the receipt card (header drifts off top) → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push phase) or `viewport-change`
- summary card / progress pill / chat bubble / brand logo / file chip spring pop-in → `spring-pop-entrance`
- summary card glides up as the findings panel expands beneath → `gsap-effects` (the glide) + `anchored-layout-expand` (the panel)
- badge flip: numbered outline → solid circle + white checkmark with scale bounce → `scale-swap-transition` (outline↔solid swap at same center) + `svg-path-draw` (checkmark draw-in) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the bounce); the pending→active→complete progression itself → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (a snap state machine, per cursor-ui-demo's workflow-approve-press precedent)
- strikethrough + dim on the checked label → `css-marker-patterns` (strike-through draw) + `gsap-effects` (opacity dim)
- partially-drawn arc outlines animating on pending items → `svg-path-draw` (partial dashoffset, held mid-draw)
- viewport scroll down the final card / internal window scroll under a static frame → `gsap-effects` (transform-only content translate inside a masked window) — use `viewport-change` only if the FRAME moves
- green/red diff counters rapid tick-and-settle → `counting-dynamic-scale` (numeric proxy count-up; suppress the scale-growth component — these tick at fixed size)
- dark thread card scales up from a row to dominate the frame → `card-morph-anchor` (row → full-frame morph + handoff) with the background darkening as a `gsap-effects` overlay fade
- reply message / resolution line expands into place → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft overshoot) or `anchored-layout-expand` for a true downward growth
- reaction button springs into an active pill with overshoot + count → `spring-pop-entrance` (the pop) + `press-release-spring` (activation flavor) + `counting-dynamic-scale` (the count, if it ticks)
- camera push-in + pan-down centering the tool call / the payoff line → `coordinate-target-zoom` (non-centered target: scale + counter-translate) or `viewport-change`
- slight pull-back then gentle end drift → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back phase + continuous micro-drift; keep the drift near-imperceptible)
- static hold on the final stack → no rule needed

**camera modifier** (default is a STATIC frame — the theater is element-level; at most ONE real move per shot, chosen from):

- Trigger push-through: a rapid push-in through the opening workspace that clears to the bare canvas → `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera`, optional `motion-blur-streak`.
- Receipt zoom: one slow continuous zoom into the checklist card across the whole mutation run, letting the header drift off the top → `multi-phase-camera` (steady push).
- Payoff push-in (sub-shape B's defining move): static through the build, then ONE push-in + pan-down tightening onto the confirmation line, easing to a micro-drift end → `coordinate-target-zoom` / `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera` (drift).
- Everything else — swaps, cascades, check-offs, scrolls — happens on a locked frame (any "scroll" is the content translating inside its window, not the camera).

**doctrine note (idle-motion ban)**: the working-state motifs (spinner rotation, pulsing dots, pulsing "Thinking") brush against motion-doctrine's idle-motion ban — here they are DIEGETIC: the pulse _performs_ "the machine is working" and is the narrative content of Scene 2, not decorative breathing. Keep every loop finite, timeline-driven, and seek-safe (`sine-wave-loop` finite repeats, `svg-icon-enrichment` rotation), and kill it at the exact frame the state resolves — the corpus does this explicitly (the loading dots vanish the instant the payload card expands; the spinner swaps out with the loader lockup).

# ASR Keyword Glow

Words in a phrase visually activate (glow blur + scale) when "spoken", following an attack-sustain-release envelope over per-word `{ start, end }` timestamps. In a real ASR pipeline the timings come from a word-level transcript (`hyperframes transcribe` — same shape); for promo video, hand-author them to control emphasis pacing. The envelope never falls to zero after a word — it decays to a rest level, leaving a breadcrumb of recent emphasis.

## How It Works

A single linear driver tween (`ease: "none"` — any other ease distorts the per-word envelope; do not change) sweeps scene time; its `onUpdate` loops over ALL words computing each one's envelope: 0 before `start`, linear attack to 1 over `ATTACK_DUR`, sustain at 1 until `end`, decay to `REST_LEVEL` over `RELEASE`, then hold at rest. The envelope drives `text-shadow` blur and `scale` — one driver for the whole phrase, never one tween per word (60+ words would bloat the timeline).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="phrase">
  <span class="word" data-word="{w1Key}">{w1}</span>
  <span class="word" data-word="{w2Key}">{w2}</span>
  <!-- … the final word may be the brand, with the .brand modifier -->
  <span class="word brand" data-word="{brandKey}">{brandWord}</span>
</div>
```

```css
.phrase {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
  color: {restColor};
}
.word {
  display: inline-block; /* required for transform on <span> */
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 {glowColorTransparent};
}
.word.brand {
  color: {brandAccentColor};
}
```

```js
// Per-word spoken windows — one entry per span; brand word 1.5-2× a normal word's window.
const TIMINGS = {
  // {w1Key}: { start: …, end: … },  — seconds, local to the scene
};

function envelope(time, start, end) {
  if (time < start) return 0;
  if (time < end) return Math.min((time - start) / ATTACK_DUR, 1);
  const releaseEnd = end + RELEASE;
  if (time < releaseEnd) return 1 - ((time - end) / RELEASE) * (1 - REST_LEVEL);
  return REST_LEVEL;
}

const words = document.querySelectorAll(".word");
const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: SCENE_DURATION,
    duration: SCENE_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // linear — t maps 1:1 to scene time
    onUpdate: () => {
      words.forEach((el) => {
        const timing = TIMINGS[el.dataset.word];
        if (!timing) return;
        const env = envelope(driver.t, timing.start, timing.end);
        el.style.textShadow = `0 0 ${MAX_BLUR * env}px ${glowColorRgba(env)}`;
        el.style.transform = `scale(${1 + MAX_SCALE_BOOST * env})`;
      });
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

`glowColorRgba(env)` returns the glow color with `env`-modulated alpha.

## Variations

- **Karaoke style (RECOMMENDED for video narration)** — the default amplitudes read too subtle in video: inactive words still dominate. Render inactive words DIM and lerp the active word toward bright + larger; at any moment 1–2 words are bright (spoken + lingering rest) and the rest is dim. Use for short phrases (5–10 words) where one word at a time should POP; keep the subtle default for long dense text. Pushes MAX_BLUR, MAX_SCALE_BOOST, and REST↔ACTIVE contrast; everything else identical:

```js
function lerpChannel(a, b, t) {
  return Math.round(a + (b - a) * t);
}
function colorAt(env, isBrand) {
  const target = isBrand ? BRAND_RGB : ACTIVE_RGB;
  return `rgb(${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.r, target.r, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.g, target.g, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.b, target.b, env)})`;
}
// in onUpdate: el.style.color = colorAt(env, el.classList.contains("brand"));
```

- **Multi-octave glow** — multiply the sustain by `1 + sin(driver.t × PULSE_HZ) × PULSE_AMPLITUDE` so high-emphasis words breathe at peak.
- **Color shift on the peak** — same channel-lerp from `restColor` → `peakColor` as `env` rises (non-karaoke form).
- **3D pop-out** — add `translateZ(env × MAX_POP_Z)` so the spoken word leans toward camera; requires `perspective` on the parent.
- **From real ASR transcripts** — convert `{ word, start_ms, end_ms }` entries to seconds and feed in identically.

| SCENE_DURATION  | = `data-duration`    | same          | driver must end in sync with the scene's seek window       |

## Critical Constraints

- **Timings monotonic, non-overlapping** — every entry's `end` < the next entry's `start`; overlapping windows make the envelope ambiguous.
- **Brand word window 1.5–2× a normal word** — the brand is the headline; let it sustain.
- **Driver ease stays `"none"`** — any other ease warps every word's envelope timing.
- **`text-shadow`, not `box-shadow`** — the glow must hug the GLYPH (speaking emphasis), not the inline-block rectangle.
- **One driver looping all words** — never one tween per word.
- **Commit to a style** — values between the default and karaoke columns yield awkward "half-loud" emphasis.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** after the final word's emphasis — the last word IS the headline beat.

# Cursor Click Ripple

An animated cursor moves to a target element, performs a click with visual depression, and emits expanding ripple rings from the click point. Three sequential phases on one timeline: **move** (eased translation to the target's center) → **click** (scale depression on cursor + target together, yoyo back) → **ripple** (1–3 staggered rings expand and fade from the click point). This is a _point event at one location_ — a sustained hold across space is [cursor-drag.md](cursor-drag.md).

## Recipe

```html
<button class="target-button">{ctaLabel}</button>
<div class="cursor"><!-- arrow SVG, positioned at the entry corner --></div>
<!-- Rings live in DOM from t=0 at the click-target CENTER, scale 0 + opacity 0 -->
<div class="ripple ripple-1"></div>
<div class="ripple ripple-2"></div>
<div class="ripple ripple-3"></div>
```

```css
.ripple {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%; /* click-target center */
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid {rippleColor};
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0);
  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

```js
// Phase 1 — Move: eased, not linear
tl.to(".cursor", { x: TARGET_X, y: TARGET_Y, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE }, 0);

// Phase 2 — Click: cursor + target depress together, then return
tl.to(
  ".cursor",
  { scale: CURSOR_PRESS_SCALE, duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power2.in", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  CLICK_AT,
);
tl.to(
  ".target-button",
  { scale: TARGET_PRESS_SCALE, duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power2.in", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  CLICK_AT,
);

// Phase 3 — Ripple burst, N rings staggered from the click point
tl.set([".ripple-1", ".ripple-2", ".ripple-3"], { opacity: 1 }, RIPPLE_AT);
tl.to(
  [".ripple-1", ".ripple-2", ".ripple-3"],
  {
    scale: RIPPLE_SCALE,
    opacity: 0,
    duration: RIPPLE_DUR,
    ease: RIPPLE_EASE,
    stagger: RIPPLE_STAGGER,
    immediateRender: false, // holds scale 0 / opacity 0 until the click moment
  },
  RIPPLE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Single ring** — one `.ripple`, no stagger; more elegant when the rest of the scene is busy.
- **Keyframed attack-decay** — a `keyframes` block ramps opacity 0 → peak → 0 across the duration; a clearer "energy radiates and dissipates" envelope.

## Critical Constraints

- **Move before click** — trigger the click only after the move tween settles; clicking mid-motion reads as unintentional.
- **Rings live in DOM from t=0** at the click-target center with `scale: 0` + `opacity: 0` — never conditionally rendered; `immediateRender: false` on the expand so they hold invisible until the trigger.
- **Ripple from the click point** — the button's visual center, not any element's bounding-box origin.
- **Synchronized depression** — cursor + target depress at the same position with the same duration, and both yoyo back.
- **Cursor above all content** (high z-index) for the whole sequence; `pointer-events: none` on cursor + ripples.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# SVG Icon Enrichment

Treats an SVG icon as a composition of animated PARTS, not an opaque image. Each meaningful internal element (a clock hand, scissor blade, recording dot, data line) gets its own micro-animation, targeted by id. Distinct from [svg-path-draw](svg-path-draw.md) (which animates the OUTLINE drawing) — enrichment animates INTERNAL PARTS, ideally after the outline has drawn.

Four signature patterns:

| Pattern     | Use For                            | Math                                  | Tip                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Rotation    | Clock, gear, loader, dial          | `rotate(deg cx cy)` attribute, linear | see the transform-center gotcha    |
| Oscillation | Scissors, wings, toggle            | `rotate(±sin·amp)` on opposing groups | opposite signs on the two parts    |
| Pulse       | Recording dot, heart, notification | `scale(1 + sin·amp)` + opacity        | ring lags dot by π/2 for ripple    |
| Dash flow   | Cutting line, data stream          | `strokeDashoffset` linear via time    | negative for L→R, positive for R→L |

## ❗ The transform-center gotcha

**For rotation around an explicit point inside an SVG, use the SVG `transform` ATTRIBUTE, not CSS transform**: `el.setAttribute("transform", `rotate(${deg} ${cx} ${cy})`)`. The CSS combination `transform: rotate(...)` + `transform-origin: 60px 60px` + `transform-box: fill-box` interprets the origin in the element's OWN **bbox-local** coordinates, NOT viewBox coordinates. For a thin `<line>` (whose bbox is the line's narrow envelope), `60 60` bbox-local is a point OUTSIDE the line — the hand flies along an off-center arc instead of rotating in place. Same trap for small inner shapes (a dot circle whose bbox is the small circle, not the full viewBox).

**Scaling around a center point**: same attribute route — `el.setAttribute("transform", `translate(${cx} ${cy}) scale(${s}) translate(-${cx} -${cy})`)`.

```

```js
// Pattern 1 — Rotation. Proxy tween → SVG transform attribute (explicit center, see gotcha).
const hand = document.getElementById("hand-min");
const minState = { deg: 0 };
tl.to(
  minState,
  {
    deg: 360 * MIN_REVOLUTIONS,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // linear motion is the point
    onUpdate: () => hand.setAttribute("transform", `rotate(${minState.deg} 60 60)`),
  },
  0,
);
// second hand: same shape with SEC_REVOLUTIONS (visibly faster).

// Pattern 3 — Pulse. One phase proxy drives dot + ring, ring offset by π/2.
const dot = document.getElementById("rec-dot");
const ring = document.getElementById("rec-ring");
const pulse = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  pulse,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * PULSE_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // sine handles the curve
    onUpdate: () => {
      const sD = 1 + Math.sin(pulse.p) * PULSE_DOT_AMP;
      const sR = 1 + Math.sin(pulse.p + Math.PI / 2) * PULSE_RING_AMP;
      dot.setAttribute("transform", `translate(60 60) scale(${sD}) translate(-60 -60)`);
      ring.setAttribute("transform", `translate(60 60) scale(${sR}) translate(-60 -60)`);
      ring.style.opacity = String(
        PULSE_RING_OPACITY_BASE + Math.sin(pulse.p) * PULSE_RING_OPACITY_AMP,
      );
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Pattern 4 — Dash flow. Linear offset tween on a dashed stroke.
const flowState = { offset: 0 };
tl.to(
  flowState,
  {
    offset: DASH_FLOW_TOTAL_OFFSET, // negative = L→R
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      document.getElementById("data-flow").style.strokeDashoffset = String(flowState.offset);
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Stroke draw → enrichment chain** — draw the outline first via [svg-path-draw](svg-path-draw.md) (phase 1, `0 → OUTLINE_DUR`), then start enrichment at `OUTLINE_DUR`: the icon "wakes up" after assembly.
- **Per-icon entry stagger** — for a row of icons, each icon's enrichment starts as it fades in, not synchronized.

| DASH_FLOW_TOTAL_OFFSET          | ±100–400             | must be an integer multiple of the dash period (dash + gap) or the end frame shows a phase jump |

## Critical Constraints

- **The transform-center gotcha above** — SVG `transform` attribute for any rotation/scale around an explicit interior point; never CSS `transform-origin` + `transform-box: fill-box` on thin lines or small inner shapes.
- **No `requestAnimationFrame`** — like CSS animation, it desyncs from HF's frame-by-frame seek; continuous motion lives inside the timeline as linear proxy tweens.
- **Amplitudes subtle** — icons are decorative, not headlines; calibrate rotation speed against composition length, not absolute time.
- **Phase-offset the parts** — minute vs second hand at different speeds, ring lagging dot by π/2. Pure sync looks mechanical.
- **`stroke-linecap: round`** on flowing/dashed lines for clean dash edges.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** — if the enrichment is the headline beat, the composition continues ≥1s after the most dramatic moment.
